## 🚀 About the Project

Welcome to the **Motion Sensing System**! This application leverages deep learning to classify human actions based on image datasets. It uses a pre-trained **VGG16 model** to achieve high accuracy in recognizing actions from input images.

### 🌟 Key Features
- **Fast and Accurate**: Utilizes a VGG16-based deep learning model.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Streamlit** for interactive input.
- **API Integration**: Flask-based REST API for predictions.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Ready for both local and cloud hosting.
